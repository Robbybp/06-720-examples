# 06-720-examples
Example code for topics covered in 06-720 Advanced Process Systems Engineering,
Spring 2021, taught by Ignacio Grossmann.

Given that the subject of the course is very computational, I thought it might
be useful to create some example code to demonstrate the concepts taught in
the class and applications thereof. Especially so because, in my experience,
code that implements or applies the algorithms used in PSE can be quite a bit
more complicated than these concepts look when written on a whiteboard.

I make no promises, but will try to update and add to these examples when I
have time. Contributions welcome.
